Releases are published to JCenter and Maven Central via [Github Actions](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-redis/actions).

A release is performed with the following steps:

- [Edit the version](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-redis/edit/master/gradle.properties) specified by `projectVersion` in `gradle.properties` to a semantic, unreleased version. Example `1.0.0`
- [Create a new release](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-redis/releases/new). The Git Tag should start with `v`. For example `v1.0.0`.
- [Monitor the Workflow](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-redis/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease) to check it passed successfully.
- Celebrate!
