It is possible to create native images for Micronaut applications that use the https://lettuce.io/[Lettuce] driver.
There are some limitations and configuration needed because of the driver itself so please make sure you read the
https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/wiki/Using-Lettuce-with-Native-Images[official driver documentation] about
GraalVM.
Micronaut provides the configuration for Netty so you don't need to add that part to your own `reflect-config.json`.


NOTE: See the section on https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#graal[GraalVM] in the user guide for more
information.
